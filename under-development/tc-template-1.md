### Definitions

#### Terms Defined Elsewhere

< It is generally more consistent to refer to an existing official definition
rather than to redefine a term. Normally, terms defined elsewhere will simply
refer to the defining document. In certain cases, it may be desirable to quote
the definition to allow for a stand-alone document. Before defining a new term,
verify whether it has already been defined in an official document elsewhere
such as in another OASIS Technical Specification, the ITU terminology database
(www.itu.i.nt/go/terms), ISO terms (https://www.iso.org/obp/ui), IEC
electropedia (https://www.electropedia.org/IEEE), or IETF. >

This document uses the following terms defined elsewhere:

 - **Term 1**: [Reference]: optional quoted definition.
 - **Term 2**: [Reference]: optional quoted definition.

#### Terms Defined in this Document

This document defines the following terms:

 - **Term 1**: some definition.
 - **Term 2**: some definition.

### Abbreviations and Acronyms

This document uses the following abbreviations and acronyms:

 - **Term 1**: expanded form.
 - **Term 2**: expanded form.

### Document Conventions

#### Key Words

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL
NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**NOT
RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14 [IETF RFC 2119] [IETF RFC 8174] when, and
only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

#### Typographical Conventions

< Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when
writing this document, such as fonts or highlighting that have special
significance. >

### Editorial Changes

< A list of editorial changes since the last balloted version. This Editoral
Changes section, between the square brackets, and including the square brackets
will be deleted after a successful ballot and during the publication
process. >

Copyright © OASIS Open 2023. All Rights Reserved.

All capitalized terms in the following text have the meanings assigned to them
in the OASIS Intellectual Property Rights Policy (the "OASIS IPR Policy"). The
full Policy may be found at the OASIS website:
[https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr/]

This document and translations of it may be copied and furnished to others, and
derivative works that comment on or otherwise explain it or assist in its
implementation may be prepared, copied, published, and distributed, in whole or
in part, without restriction of any kind, provided that the above copyright
notice and this section are included on all such copies and derivative works.
However, this document itself may not be modified in any way, including by
removing the copyright notice or references to OASIS, except as needed for the
purpose of developing any document or deliverable produced by an OASIS
Technical Committee (in which case the rules applicable to copyrights, as set
forth in the OASIS IPR Policy, must be followed) or as required to translate it
into languages other than English.

The limited permissions granted above are perpetual and will not be revoked by
OASIS or its successors or assigns.

This document and the information contained herein is provided on an "AS IS"
basis and OASIS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY THAT THE USE OF THE INFORMATION HEREIN WILL NOT
INFRINGE ANY OWNERSHIP RIGHTS OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. OASIS AND ITS MEMBERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ANY USE
OF THIS DOCUMENT OR ANY PART THEREOF.

As stated in the OASIS IPR Policy, the following three paragraphs in brackets
apply to OASIS Standards Final Deliverable documents (Committee Specifications,
OASIS Standards, or Approved Errata).

OASIS requests that any OASIS Party or any other party that believes it has
patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this
OASIS Standards Final Deliverable, to notify OASIS TC Administrator and provide
an indication of its willingness to grant patent licenses to such patent claims
in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that
produced this deliverable.

OASIS invites any party to contact the OASIS TC Administrator if it is aware of
a claim of ownership of any patent claims that would necessarily be infringed
by implementations of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable by a patent holder
that is not willing to provide a license to such patent claims in a manner
consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that produced
this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable. OASIS may include such claims on its
website, but disclaims any obligation to do so.

OASIS takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual
property or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation
or use of the technology described in this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable or
the extent to which any license under such rights might or might not be
available; neither does it represent that it has made any effort to identify
any such rights. Information on OASIS' procedures with respect to rights in any
document or deliverable produced by an OASIS Technical Committee can be found
on the OASIS website. Copies of claims of rights made available for publication
and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an
attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of such
proprietary rights by implementers or users of this OASIS Standards Final
Deliverable, can be obtained from the OASIS TC Administrator. OASIS makes no
representation that any information or list of intellectual property rights
will at any time be complete, or that any claims in such list are, in fact,
Essential Claims.

The name "OASIS" is a trademark of OASIS, the owner and developer of this
document, and should be used only to refer to the organization and its official
outputs. OASIS welcomes reference to, and implementation and use of, documents,
while reserving the right to enforce its marks against misleading uses. Please
